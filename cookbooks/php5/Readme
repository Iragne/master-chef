#APC

APC is a subrecipe of php5
it is exposed on its own virtual host on localhost:2323 only

You have two pages :

localhost:2323/apc.php which give apc stats
localhost:2323/apc_clear_cache.php which allow to reset the cache content

To proceed theses pages a curl is launched locally (with cap or handly)
